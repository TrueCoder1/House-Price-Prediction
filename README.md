# House-Price-Prediction
House price prediction using Linear regression

This is a famous data set for beginners practicing regression. In this program, I will implement Simpe multivariate linear regression to predict the house prices.

# Which DataSet is this?:
[Armes Housing Dataset](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf) is an alternative to commonly used Boston Housing dataset.


# What you would need to run .ipynb file?
Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda distribution


# What libraries are used in the code?
scikitlearn, pandas, numpy and matplotlib.


# Well, something more about the dataset?


# How were the features transformed before fitting the model?


# which linear regression is used?



# How was the score improved? How are the hyperparameters selected?




# what did we achieve from running this model?
